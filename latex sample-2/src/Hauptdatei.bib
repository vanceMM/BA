title="Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due: Designing Open Badges for a Technology Integration Course",
journal="TechTrends",
year="2013",
volume="57",
number="6",
pages="88--95",
abstract="This paper describes the design, development, and implementation of Open Badges into a secondary education preservice course on instructional technology. Open Badges provide a new way of issuing credentials to individuals who demonstrate knowledge, skill, or ability in a particular domain. Badges provide a simple system for communicating a skill along with specific information about the evidence connected with earning the badge. In this paper, we describe the course in detail along with the several iterations of design that resulted in the development of the badge system, along with the challenges faced and lessons learned for future design and use of Open Badges.",
